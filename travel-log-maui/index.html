    <p>When I left Seattle, I jokingly told my friend "the first country I'm travelling to is Hawaii".</p>
<p>"But it is isn't a different country," she replied.</p>
<p>It is.  Oh it is.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_1.jpg" alt="Image of Maui from Kula Lodge" /></p>
<p><em>Looking at Maui from the Kula Lodge</em></p>
<p>Having travelled around the United States, I can't say there are many places even similar to Hawaii.  Or, more precisely, Maui, the island I spent most of my time on this past week.</p>
<p>To start with many of the views look absolutely, totally fake.  Yes, the above picture was my view at lunch one day.  Only after staying in Maui for a week did I start to get used to the fact that driving around the interior of Maui, at any moment you could turn the corner and see another breath-taking view.</p>
<p>I don't know if I could get used to it <em>really</em>.  Half my shots of the beach or looking out over the mountain look like they're from a postcard.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_2.jpg" alt="Image of Kamaole Beach III" /></p>
<p><em>Kamaole Beach III</em></p>
<p>Sure, I guess someone might over time get used to the amazing mixture of volcanic rock, perfect beaches, and mountain views rounded out with gorgeous weather.  Add to that easy access to a wide variety of fresh produce and fish, and you have yourself a quite literal slice of paradise.  It became quickly obvious why Hawaii has its reputation.  It is, quite simply, nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>To give it an even more foreign feel, I was greeted by a number of foods and plants I'd never heard of before.  Fruit that tastes like cinnamon (complete with a gritty texture), starfruit, and even the plentyful macadamia nuts used in new ways (like in the crust on Mahi Mahi, for example).</p>
<p>Speaking of macadamia nuts...</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_5.jpg" alt="Image of Spam-flavored Macademia nuts" /></p>
<p>Like I said, a variety of foods.  The plants, too, came in all shapes and sizes.  One of the most striking is the Rainbow Eucalyptus.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_3.jpg" alt="Image of Rainbow Eucalyptus" />
<em>Rainbow Eucalyptus at Garden of Eden</em></p>
<p>The above picture is from the <a href="http://mauigardenofeden.com/">Garden of Eden</a> on the Road to Hana.  Both the Garden and the Road to Hana are well worth exploring.  The Road is a windy affair that takes you around through some of the various micro-climates as you traverse the island.  My friend and I explored it one day, stopping at the Garden of Eden, a nature reserve that contained many cool varieties of plants, including the Rainbow Eucalyptus above.  In addition, many varieties of bamboo, bananas, flowers of various sorts, and starfruit flourish.</p>
<p>But you don't really have to go very far in any direction to get the island experience.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_4.jpg" alt="Image of Maui Beach" /></p>
<p>Maui, as one may expect being a holiday spot for many, is a great reminder to take things a little slower.  Stop and look at the flowers, enjoy the views, soak in the sun, and rest up for whatever adventure might come along tomorrow.  There's also a general friendly, caring spirit that people generally strive for called the Aloha Spirit, sharing its name with the famous greeting.  As a sense of goodwill, it carries through the island's inhabitants and even into <a href="http://www.uhcc.hawaii.edu/aloha/alohaSpirit.php">governance</a>.  Just as important as soaking in the sun is to soak in some of the Aloha while you're there and take it with you.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Maui_6.jpg" alt="Image of rocks spelling Aloha" /></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to returning to Hawaii and seeing what else it has to offer.  Like many places, it feels like I just scratched the surface.  What I found was a warm, welcoming place, both in temperature and in vibe.  Highly recommended checking it out.  It's well-worth the flight.  Just don't rush too much, or you'll miss some of the best parts.</p>
<p>Mahalo for reading!</p>
