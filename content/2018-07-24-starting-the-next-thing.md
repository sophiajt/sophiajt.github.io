It's that time again! July 31st will be my last day at Mozilla. 

Even though I was only at Mozilla for just under two and a half years, I had the good fortune to work on some pretty awesome projects.

I joined the Rust team and worked with Niko Matsakis and Aaron Turon on where Rust could grow, building on my experience coming from TypeScript. We learned a *ton* from each other, and I'm really grateful for all those conversations and the close friendship that resulted. I also got to roll up my sleeves and write some code. The first project was to [redesign the Rust error messages](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html) with Niko. The next was to create the [Rust Language Server](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/introducing-rust-language-server-source-release/4209) with Nick Cameron. Both have grown a life of their own, and it's been awesome to see!

I was also lucky to help Jack Moffitt out with the Servo project. Under his guidance, it produced loads of good code and good ideas. These made their way into [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/) and into the [Firefox Reality](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/04/03/mozilla-brings-firefox-augmented-virtual-reality/) work. Learning from Jack and connecting with the Firefox org (and some of the awesome Firefox managers) was a treat.

Finally, my last seven months have been helping create and run the Developer Technology team at Mozilla, a melding of the Rust and WebAssembly efforts under one umbrella. This allowed even closer collaboration between the two projects and has already resulted in [lots of cool new technology, tools, and coding practices](https://rustwasm.github.io/). I'm excited to watch what they'll be able to come up with next.

And speaking of "next", what's next for me?  I'm moving on to create a new company.  I don't have a ton of details to share, yet, but I hope to do so in the coming months as the ideas and technology start to come together.  "Will it use Rust?" I can already hear many of you asking.  Most assuredly.  If there's a better solution for efficient, write-once-and-don't-worry-about-it software development, I've yet to find it. 

Thank you, Mozilla!  Both for the experience and for the friends I've made along the way.


PS: I plan to continue podcasting - it's fun :)
