Below Dani Finn, Issy Waldrom, and myself compiled a list of trans lesbian books. If this list is missing entries, please let me know!

Just to be clear on the terms we're using for the list:

- trans - the main character, or at least one significant POV, must be trans
- lesbian - the main character, or at least one significant POV, must be lesbian
- also, there are no romantic/sexual encounters with men
